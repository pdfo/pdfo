PDFO is a cross-platform package providing the late `Professor M. J. D. Powell <https://www.zhangzk.net/powell.html>`_'s derivative-free (i.e., zeroth-order) optimization solvers.
Using only function values, but not derivatives, it solves problems of the form

.. math::

    \min_{x \in \R^n} \quad \obj ( x ) \quad \text{s.t.} \quad
    \begin{cases}
        \xl \le x \le \xu,\\
        \aub x \le \bub, ~ \aeq x = \beq,\\
        \cub ( x ) \le 0, ~ \ceq ( x ) = 0.
    \end{cases}

To install PDFO for Python, run in your terminal

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pdfo

You can also check the :ref:`installation guide for MATLAB<installation-matlab>`.
For more details, see the :ref:`user guide<user-guide>`.

Statistics
----------

As of |today|, PDFO has been downloaded |total_downloads| times, including

- |github_downloads| times on `GitHub <https://hanadigital.github.io/grev/?user=pdfo&repo=pdfo>`_,
- |pypi_downloads| times on `PyPI <https://pypistats.org/packages/pdfo>`_ (`mirror downloads <https://pypistats.org/faqs>`_ excluded), and
- |conda_downloads| times on `Anaconda <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pdfo>`_.

The following figure shows the cumulative downloads of PDFO.

We started tracking the downloads of PDFO on `Anaconda <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pdfo>`_ on October 2022.
The API we employ to track the downloads of PDFO on `Anaconda <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pdfo>`_ only provides the cumulative downloads.
Therefore, we do not know when the downloads of PDFO on `Anaconda <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pdfo>`_ have been made.
In this plot, all of them are assumed to have been made on October 2022.
